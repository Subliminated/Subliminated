👋 Hi, I’m Gordon and welcome to my ✨Github✨

🌱 About me: A post-grad student with a passion for dabbling with data and analytics. 
In my spare-time, I enjoy challenging myself by learning new thing and staying active 🏃

❓ What's on my Github: Here you can find a compilation of cool projects I've worked on and some university projects (that I remembered to document 😅).
These will be added over time (slowly..🐌) when I find the time to do so.

💡 My interests: Machine learning, python, analytics, experimentation, segmentation, coding.
