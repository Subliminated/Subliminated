👋 Hi, I’m Gordon and welcome to my Github 

Here you can find a compilation of some projects I've worked on and some university coursework (that I remembered to document 😅).
These will be added over time (slowly..🐌) but we all got to start somewhere.

📫 If you want to chat, you can reach out to me via LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/gordon-lam-bab794112/

Subliminated/Subliminated is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
