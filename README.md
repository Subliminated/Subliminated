👋 Hi, I’m Gordon and welcome to my ✨Github✨

🌱 A little about me: Just some post-grad student with a passion for dabbling with data and working in the Digital Data and Analytics space. 
In my spare-time, I enjoy challenging myself by learning new thing (e.g. check this repo out🔥🔥🔥) and staying active 🏃

❓ What's on my Github: Here you can find a compilation of cool projects I've worked on and some university projects (that I remembered to document 😅).
These will be added over time (albeit slowly..🐌) when I find the time to do so.

💡 My interests: Currently learning how to extract financial data from APIs and analysing/forecasting stock prices in Python.
Will look to expand stack progressively (e.g. storing financial data on a local db) to include new technologies.
